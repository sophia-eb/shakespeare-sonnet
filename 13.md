### **莎士比亚十四行诗第13首**

**English:**

O, that you were yourself, but, love, you are

No longer yours than you yourself here live;

Against this coming end you should prepare,

And your sweet semblance to some other give.

So should that beauty which you hold in lease

Find no determination, then you were

Yourself again after your self’s decease,

When your sweet issue your sweet form should bear.

Who lets so fair a house fall to decay,

Which husbandry in honour might uphold

Against the stormy gusts of winter’s day

And barren rage of death’s eternal cold?

O, none but unthrifts! Dear my love, you know,

You had a father; let your son say so.

**中文翻译：**

愿你永远是你自己呵！可是，我爱，

你如今活着，将来会不属于自己：

你该准备去对抗末日的到来，

把你可爱的形体让别人来承继。

这样，你那租借得来的美影，

就能够克服时间，永远不到期：

你死后可以重新成为你自身，

只要你儿子保有你美丽的形体。

谁会让这么美好的屋子垮下去，

不用勤勉和节俭来给以支柱，

来帮他对抗冬天的狂风暴雨，

对抗死神的毁灭一切的冷酷？

只有败家子才会这样呵——你明白：

你有父亲，你儿子也该有啊，我爱！
